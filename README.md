## Description

Notris is a modern web-based Tetris implementation that allows players to compete against each other in real-time multiplayer matches. Players can create or join game rooms, ready up for matches, and play head-to-head Tetris with live opponent visibility and game state synchronization.

**Key Features:**
- üéÆ **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play Tetris against opponents with live game state synchronization
- üè† **Room System**: Create private or public rooms with customizable starting levels
- üë• **User Management**: Secure registration and authentication with JWT tokens
- üìä **Live Updates**: See your opponent's board, score, and progress in real-time
- üîÑ **Reconnection Handling**: Automatic reconnection and proper disconnect notifications
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Match Timer**: Track game duration during multiplayer matches
- üéØ **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern web interface that works across devices

## Why?

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern web application development, showcasing several key technical challenges:

**Real-time Communication**: Building a responsive multiplayer experience requires careful WebSocket management, message routing, and state synchronization between clients.

**Scalable Architecture**: The application demonstrates clean separation of concerns with a Go backend handling game logic and WebSocket connections, while a JavaScript frontend manages the user interface and real-time updates.

**User Experience**: Creating an engaging multiplayer game involves solving complex UX challenges like connection handling, room management, player notifications, and seamless game state transitions.

**Full-Stack Development**: The project integrates backend services (Go, PostgreSQL), real-time communication (WebSockets), and frontend technologies (HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript) into a cohesive application.

### About the developer
Hi! I'm Isaac, and I've been fascinated with programming for a long time. I‚Äôd write games in Python, or work on a website for fun here and there, and always enjoyed coding. After 4 years as a mechanic, I‚Äôve realized I have a real skill for this programming stuff, and decided to properly learn how to do it by taking some in-depth CS and backend development courses. Now that I‚Äôve completed those and have several real-world projects under my belt, I‚Äôm excited for a full-time career in software engineering.

I'm now intimately familiar with Go, which has quickly become my favorite language to write in.
