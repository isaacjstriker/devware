# Notris Online

A real-time multiplayer Tetris game built with Go and WebSockets, featuring user authentication, room-based matchmaking, and live gameplay synchronization.

## Description

Notris is a modern web-based Tetris implementation that allows players to compete against each other in real-time multiplayer matches. Players can create or join game rooms, ready up for matches, and play head-to-head Tetris with live opponent visibility and game state synchronization.

**Key Features:**
- üéÆ **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play Tetris against opponents with live game state synchronization
- üè† **Room System**: Create private or public rooms with customizable starting levels
- üë• **User Management**: Secure registration and authentication with JWT tokens
- üìä **Live Updates**: See your opponent's board, score, and progress in real-time
- üîÑ **Reconnection Handling**: Automatic reconnection and proper disconnect notifications
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Match Timer**: Track game duration during multiplayer matches
- üéØ **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern web interface that works across devices

## Why?

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern web application development, showcasing several key technical challenges:

**Real-time Communication**: Building a responsive multiplayer experience requires careful WebSocket management, message routing, and state synchronization between clients.

**Scalable Architecture**: The application demonstrates clean separation of concerns with a Go backend handling game logic and WebSocket connections, while a JavaScript frontend manages the user interface and real-time updates.

**User Experience**: Creating an engaging multiplayer game involves solving complex UX challenges like connection handling, room management, player notifications, and seamless game state transitions.

**Full-Stack Development**: The project integrates backend services (Go, PostgreSQL), real-time communication (WebSockets), and frontend technologies (HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript) into a cohesive application.
